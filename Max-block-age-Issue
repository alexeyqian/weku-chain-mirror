Note:
one minor check:
after unregistered, before stop the chain, wait around 5 seconds, and in your cli_wallet, run command: get_active_witnesses, check the return witness lists, make sure your name are not there
then you can safely stop the chain
vise versa, after registered, run the same command to check your name is in the list.
